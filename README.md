# FIRA Air Autonomous Race U19

This repository contains my implementation for the **FIRA Air Autonomous Race (U19 category)**. The project uses a real **DJI Tello drone** equipped with external image processing to autonomously detect gates and complete the race track.

## Competition Goals

The objective of the FIRA Air Autonomous Race is to develop drones capable of completing a race track without human intervention. The main requirements include:

- Autonomous detection of gates using computer vision  
- Navigation through each gate in the correct sequence  
- Completion of the track without faults  
- Achieving the fastest possible time compared to competitors  

This challenge emphasizes the integration of programming, robotics, and vision-based navigation.

## Technical Approach

The implementation in this repository focuses on:

- **Image Processing with AprilTags**: Using a camera feed to detect AprilTags placed on race gates  
- **Drone Control with DJI Tello**: Sending movement commands (yaw, pitch, roll, throttle) to the Tello drone based on vision input  
- **Gate Navigation**: Aligning with each gate and passing through in the correct order  
- **Autonomous Flight Sequence**: Coordinating detection, decision-making, and control to complete the race track  

## Code Overview

The main script, [`fira_air.py`](./fira_air.py), connects to the Tello drone, streams video, and processes each frame to detect AprilTags marking the race gates. Based on the tagâ€™s position and orientation, the code computes alignment and distance adjustments, then issues control commands to the drone.  
It works as a simple state machine: searching for tags, aligning with the gate, and flying through it. A live video feed with visualized detections is displayed for debugging, and the program ensures the drone lands safely when stopped.

## Future Work

Potential improvements include:

- Enhancing vision algorithms for faster and more reliable gate detection  
- Implementing adaptive control strategies for smoother navigation  
- Optimizing the system for reduced latency between perception and control
